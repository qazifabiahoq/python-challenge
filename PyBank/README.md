PyBank Financial Analysis:
This Python project involves a script that conducts a financial analysis using data from the "budget_data.csv" file. The analysis encompasses several key calculations:

*Determining the total number of months included in the dataset.
*Calculating the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire dataset period.
*Analyzing the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the dataset period, including the calculation of the average of those changes.
*Identifying the greatest increase in profits, including the date and amount, over the entire dataset period.
*Identifying the greatest decrease in profits, including the date and amount, over the entire dataset period.

How to Use:
To execute the PyBank analysis, run the main.py script using Python. The script reads data from the "budget_data.csv" file and produces the analysis results.

Files:
main.py: The primary Python script for performing the financial analysis.
Resources/budget_data.csv: The dataset used for the analysis.
Analysis Results
The results of the financial analysis are stored in the Analysis folder.
