# Python Challenge
This project consists of two Python assignments, PyBank and PyPoll. The purpose of these scripts is to analyze financial records and election data, respectively. The results are then printed to the terminal and exported to a text file.
Project Description: In this project, you will find two main scripts, main.py for both PyBank and PyPoll assignments.
PyBank:
The PyBank assignment involves analyzing financial records from a CSV file named budget_data.csv. It calculates:
*The total number of months in the dataset.
*The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
*The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and the average of those changes.
*The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
*The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
The results are printed to the terminal and exported to a text file called financial_analysis.txt located in the "Analysis" folder.
PyPoll:
The PyPoll assignment involves analyzing election data from a CSV file named election_data.csv. It calculates:
*The total number of votes cast.
*A list of candidates who received votes.
*The percentage of votes each candidate won.
*The total number of votes each candidate won.
*The winner of the election based on popular vote.
The results are printed to the terminal and exported to a text file called election_results.txt located in the "Analysis" folder.
File Structure:
The project is organized as follows:

PyBank/ contains the PyBank assignment files.

main.py: The Python script for PyBank.
Resources/: The folder containing the budget_data.csv file.
Analysis/: The folder where the results, financial_analysis.txt, are stored.

PyPoll/ contains the PyPoll assignment files.

main.py: The Python script for PyPoll.
Resources/: The folder containing the election_data.csv file.
